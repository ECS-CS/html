# HTML (10 MINS)

The time you been waiting for. We will make functional navigational links.

We will be focusing on this section:

```html
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li>Home</li>
      <li>About</li>
      <li>Projects</li>
      <li>Contact Me</li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
```

## STEP 1:

Each `<li>.....</li>` element has to be updated to include anchor tags, that link somewhere. We will make our links pull our attention to a different part of our webpage.

```html
<li>Home</li>
```

## STEP 2:

Using the example above, lets surround the **Home** text with `<a></a>` tags.

For example:

```html
<li><a>Home</a></li>
```

## STEP 3:

Does anyone remember the HTML attribute that is **required** in all anchor tags? Starts with **h** and ends with **f**.

```html
<li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
```

## STEP 4:

We've successfully added our first link to our nav bar. **BUT** this link doesn't go anywhere. We need to create a new HTML element for it to navigate to.

```html
<div id="home">My Content Goes Here</div>
```

## STEP 1:
