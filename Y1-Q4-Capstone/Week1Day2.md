# FORKING

1.  After logging into CodePen
2.  Click the profile icon in the top right and go to **Your Profile**

4.  Then, **FORK** this project and rename the new version to **CAPSTONE PROJECT 2** (ALL CAPS)

# HOUSE KEEPING

1.  After opening **CAPSTONE PROJECT 2**
2.  Click **Settings**, in the toolbar
    ![Settings](../assets/settings.png)
3.  Click **Behavior** and then in **Auto-Updating Preview** section:
    ![Behavior](../assets/disabled.png)
4.  Uncheck **ENABLED**

# HTML (10 MINS)

## STEP 1:

**Updating our previous HTML structure:**

Let's add a **class** with a value of **header** to the first div, after the opening `<header>` tag, but **BEFORE** the opening `<nav>` tag.

```html
<div>Mr. Bostwick's Blog</div>
```

**becomes**

```html
<div class="header">Mr. Bostwick's Blog</div>
```

## STEP 2:

In the CSS section of CodePen lets change **div** to **.header**.
![Header](../assets/header.png)

## STEP 3:

We are going to focus on the body of our webpage by creating two equally sized columns.

Let's copy and paste the below code **after** the closing `</header>` tag but **BEFORE** the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
  <div class="container">
    <div class="col1">
      Column 1
    </div>
    <div class="col2">
      Column 2
    </div>
  </div>
```

## STEP 4:

We are going to embed our Scratch Capstone Project into our webpage.

1.  Let's open https://phosphorus.github.io/ in a New Tab. **(right click, Open Link in New Tab)**
2.  Sign into your Scratch Account: https://scratch.mit.edu/
3.  Go to the **project page** of your Scratch Capstone Project.
4.  **COPY** the **WHOLE** URL from the URL bar.

## (ex: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]/)

5.  Insert your **YOUR PROJECT** url into the box below:
    ![Project URL](../assets/phos.png)
6.  Once the new page loads, **copy** the text in the box below:
    ![Embed Scratch](../assets/embedscratch.png)
7.  Go back to **CodePen** and replace the "Column 1" text with the script tags you copied.
    ![First](../assets/first.png)
8.  After replacing "Column 1" your **CodePen** should look similar to this:
    ![Second](../assets/second.png)

# CSS (1 MIN)

## STEP 1:

We are going to style the columns we created above using the code below.

Let's copy and paste the code below in the CSS section of CodePen below what we currently have.

```css
/* GRID */

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 10px;
  margin-top: 10px;
}

.col1,
.col2 {
  height: 400px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

# ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ HOMEWORK ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

## To receive full credit for this part of your Capstone Project, you will have to do the following:

## HTML CHANGES

(These changes will be made in the **HTML section of CodePen**)

1.  Embed your capstone project into the left column (Column #1).
2.  Insert `<p></p>` tags into the right column (Column #2).
3.  Inside the `<p></p>` tags describe your Scratch Project. (Minimum of 3 sentences)
4.  Insert a header tag **ABOVE** the `<p></p>` tags you created and insert text between them. (ex: `<h1></h1>` or `<h2></h2>`).

## CSS CHANGES

(These changes will be made in the **CSS section of CodePen**)

5.  Target the `<p>` tag you created in #2, and style it. (ex: Change the font size, color, font-weight, text-align, etc..)
6.  Target the header tag you created in #4 and style it.

# FINISHED CODE

If for any reason you lose your code, or came late to class, absent or (anything else you can think of that kept you from completing this lesson), you can **FORK** this pen to create a copy to your account.

Any other words, this is your **starting point** before you complete your deliverables.
